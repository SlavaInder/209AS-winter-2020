# Overall Project Goal
Our goal is to create an adversarial patch robust against folds for adaptability in the physical world. 

### Specific Aims:

- Present an algorithm to train the adversarial patch
- Determine the accuracies for the training set and test set
- Evaluate the performance of applicable regularization techniques 

# Our Approach
In order to fulfill the goal of our project, we created a set of distorted adversarial patches for evaluation obtained from ImageNet's database. We then evaluated the performances of these patches with Inceptionv3 and looked to maximize the loss function for this classifier. Based on our experimental results, we demonstrated the capability of producing an adversarial patch robust against potential real-life visual deformities to fool image/object detection systems.
