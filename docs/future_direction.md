# Future Direction
In conclusion, the results of our project demonstrated the ability to create an adversarial patch robust to the variant and unpredictable perturbations of the physical world. The possibility of mounting successful physical adversarial attacks are highly probable based upon our research and is applicable to the previously researched papers regarding adversarial attacks through the usage of hats, shirts, and potentially glasses. 

## Strengths
#### Demonstration of adaptability of adversarial patches into the physical world
As stated

## Limitations
- 

## Improvements to Future Iterations
